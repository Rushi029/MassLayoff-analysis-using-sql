## Layoffs Data Analysis with MySQL

##📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Cleaning of a Layoffs Dataset using MySQL. The dataset contains information about company layoffs, including affected industries, locations, funding, and trends over time.

📂 Dataset Information
The dataset includes:
  -Company – Name of the company
  -Location – City of the company
  -Industry – Sector the company operates in
  -Total_Laid_Off – Number of employees affected
  -Percentage_Laid_Off – Percentage of employees laid off
  -Date – Date of layoff event
  -Stage – Funding stage of the company
  -Country – Country where the company is based
  -Funds_Raised – Total funds raised by the company
  
🛠️ Data Cleaning Steps
  -Converted Date formats to ensure consistency
  -Handled missing values in Percentage_Laid_Off and Funds_Raised
  -Identified duplicate records for data integrity
  -Standardized data types
  
📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  -Industry-wise Layoffs: Analyzing the most affected industries
  -Top Companies with Layoffs: Identifying major layoffs
  -Layoff Trends Over Time: Understanding how layoffs evolved over months and years
  -Country-Wise Layoffs: Finding out the most affected regions
  -Funding vs. Layoffs Correlation: Analyzing if higher funding affects layoffs
  
📝 SQL Queries

The SQL queries include:
✔️ Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, formatting dates, finding duplicates
✔️ EDA Queries: Aggregating data to uncover insights

🚀 How to Use
  -Import the dataset into MySQL
  -Run the SQL scripts for data cleaning
  -Execute EDA queries to explore insights

📌 Key Takeaways
  -The tech industry is one of the most affected sectors
  -Startups in later funding stages often have higher layoffs
  -Some countries have significantly higher layoff rates
  -Layoffs often correlate with company funding situations
